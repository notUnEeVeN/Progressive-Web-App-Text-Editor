## Description

This is the 19th Module project for the UCB Coding Bootcamp's 19th week. Throughout this week, we used our knowledge of SQL database management, routing techniques, password authentication, hashing, etc to construct a Text Editor PWA. This Progressive Web Application offers users an offline-capable text editor, enabling them to seamlessly write and edit content, ensuring convenience and flexibility in various network conditions.
